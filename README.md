# mStream
A music player incorporating basic/intermediate Java functionalities with a highly object-oriented structure for Android devices. Utilises Firestore as a database for songs.

# What it does
1. Google sign-in system (no email logged)
2. Search system to filter through existing songs
3. Queue preview
4. 'Like' songs
5. Create playlists/add songs to existing ones
6. Songs are dynamically loaded in from Firestore

I recommend beginner Android developers to look through this app's code. A lot of it is 're-compiled' Stack Overflow questions and answers that a newbie would search for, so there's a good chance that I've faced the same problems that you have! I should also note that this app is a submission for a school project. 

A few Java fundamentals and basic Firestore knowledge are required.

Note: This Android app does not 100% follow the MVVM architecture. It looks like a mess right now but this might/will be fixed in the future.
